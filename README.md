My portfolio to showcase my work as a developer.  The main attraction is the portfolio section of the site where you can see some of the different projects I have worked on in my time as a developer.  Each project has a preview image as well as links to the github and the live site.

My resume is also available to preview on the site or to download in full.  The about me page gives you a little bit about my background and what I hope to accomplish, and the contact page allows you to reach out to me if you so choose.
